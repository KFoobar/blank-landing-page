# Simple placeholder page

Landing page for blank domains.

## About

This is a simple and clean landing page that I use as placeholder for blank domains until I'm ready to push the the "real" webpage to production.
Particularly useful for newly created sites on Laravel Forge that prints `phpinfo()` on the default page.

You a free to use it as well if you find it useful. Contributions and ideas are welcome!
